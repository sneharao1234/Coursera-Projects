#### Project summaries

#### Project 1 - Predict loan status (in collection or paid-off) 
Performed various feature extraction / creation / selection tasks on a combination of categorical and continuous features. 
Built machine learning classification models like Logistic regression, K nearest neighbours, Desicion Trees and Support Vector Machines and compared their performance.

Results:
| Model             |Jaccard	|F1-score	|LogLoss |
|-------------------|---------|---------|--------|
|KNN	              |0.7714	  |0.7695	  |NA      |
|Decision Tree	    |0.7540	  |0.7687	  |NA      |
|SVM	              |0.7580	  |0.6648	  |NA      |
|Logistic Regression|0.7514	  |0.6448	  |0.5583  |

#### Project 2 - Predict strength of concrete  
Built various regression models by varying network parameters such as feature normalization, number of epochs, number of hidden layers, etc and compared thir performance. 

#### Project 3 - Identify images if concrete with cracks in them
Built image classification networks using ResNet50 and VGG16 and compared their performance.
